# Verilator C++ testbench

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
export const adder_v = require('!!raw-loader!../../../examples/verilator/adder/adder.v')?.default;
export const cmakelists = require('!!raw-loader!../../../examples/verilator/CMakeLists.txt')?.default;
export const adder_cmakelists = require('!!raw-loader!../../../examples/verilator/adder/CMakeLists.txt')?.default;
export const main_cpp = require('!!raw-loader!../../../examples/verilator/main.cpp')?.default;

### Description

This example shows how to create a C++ testbench and instantiate a Verilated RTL IP library.

In this case we will have an IP library called `adder`, that is just a simple combinatorial adder with only 1 file `adder.v`.<br/>
We will also have a C++ testbench `main.cpp`

## Example

### Directory structure

Lets take a look at the directory structure of the example first.

```raw
.
├── adder
│   ├── adder.v
│   └── CMakeLists.txt
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── deps
│   ├── CPM.cmake
│   └── deps.cmake
└── main.cpp
```

We have a directory `adder/` that contains the `adder` IP block, it as its own `CMakeLists.txt` to make it easier to reuse in a larger project.
:::tip
For a design this simple it is not really necessary to have a separate `CMakeLists.txt`, but it is a good practice anyways.
:::

### adder/adder.v

Adder verilog file is just a simple two 8bit inputs, and a 9bit output module.

<CodeBlock language="verilog" title="adder/adder.v" showLineNumbers>{adder_v}</CodeBlock>

### adder/CMakeLists.txt

There is nothing new in this file from previous examples.
We are making a library under the full name `cern::ip::adder::0.0.1`.

<CodeBlock language="cmake" title="adder/CMakeLists.txt" showLineNumbers>{adder_cmakelists}</CodeBlock>

### main.cpp

This is a standard C++ testbench using a Verilated model. Refer to Verilator documentation for more information.

<CodeBlock language="cpp" title="main.cpp" showLineNumbers>{main_cpp}</CodeBlock>


### CMakeLists.txt

And finally we need a top `CMakeLists.txt` that will assemble the full design and create simulation targets.

<CodeBlock language="cmake" title="CMakeLists.txt" showLineNumbers>{cmakelists}</CodeBlock>

We can add the `adder` IP as a subdirectory with [`add_subdirectory()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_subdirectory.html) CMake function.

Then we are creating the target to Verilate the IP.
Executing the `cern__ip__adder__0.0.1_verilate` target will compile a [static library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_library) of the IP block.<br/>
This time we are not asking Verilator to create a `main.cpp` file as we will write it ourselves.<br/>
We are also passing `TRACE` argument to `verilate()`, indicating that we want to enable [`VCD`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump) generation in Verilated model.

After that we create an `executable` with [`add_executable()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_executable.html) CMake function. The first argument is the name of the compiled executable, and then we pass a list of sources, in this case only `main.cpp`

Finally we use [`target_link_libraries()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html), to link the Verilated static library into our testbench executable, and also add the include paths for headers of the Verilated model, and Verilator headers.


:::tip
Notice in the line 11, we are linking to the static library created with Verilator.
It is a bit annoying to have to change the version number manually, in order to avoid it it is a better idea to set a variable in `adder/CMakeLists.txt` that will hold the full name of the IP.
```cmake title="adder/CMakeLists.txt"
...
if(NOT PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL)    # Avoid warning if project is top level
    set(ADDER_LIB_NAME ${IP} PARENT_SCOPE)
endif()
```
And then in `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake title="CMakeLists.txt"
...
target_link_libraries(testbench ${ADDER_LIB_NAME}__vlt)
```

### Build graph

Take a look at the build graph for this example.
We can see that the `testbench` executable depends on Verilated models and Verilator targets.
Executing the `testbench` targets, the dependencies will be built first.


<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src={require('../../../examples/verilator/graph.png').default}
    alt="graph"
  />
</div>

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src={require('../../../examples/verilator/legend.png').default}
    alt="graph"
    width="80%"
  />
</div>

## Running the simulation

Simulation can be run the same way as always:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../                  # Configure project
make testbench -j$(nproc)  # Build testbench
./testbench                # Execute testbench
```

:::tip
Use [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) to autocomplete `make` target names.
After typing `make ` press `Tab ↹` twice.
