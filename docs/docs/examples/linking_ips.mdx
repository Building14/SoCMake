# Hierarchical design

import { Graphviz } from 'graphviz-react';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
export const graph = require('!!raw-loader!../../..//examples/linking_ips/graph.dot')?.default;
export const cmakelists = require('!!raw-loader!../../../examples/linking_ips/CMakeLists.txt')?.default;

SoCMake promotes hierarchical design, by organizing IP blocks into IP libraries, we can easily reuse IP blocks into different designs.

Let's try to create a bit more complex example to demonstrate how to link different libraries together.
Imagine the following graph.<br/>
*   We have a `top` IP that instantiates some primitives: `prim10` and `prim11`.
*   `prim10` depends on `prim00`.
*   `prim11` depends on `prim00` and `prim01`.

## Graph

<Graphviz dot={graph}/>

## CMakeLists.txt

We can create this hierarchy with the following `CMakeLists.txt`

<CodeBlock language="verilog" title="CMakeLists.txt" showLineNumbers>{cmakelists}</CodeBlock>

:::warning
We can see in the highlighted lines `add_ip()` function calls, that we are adding IPs without `VENDOR`, `LIBRARY`, `VERSION` format, instead we only pass the `NAME`.
This is not recommended, and we set `SOCMAKE_NOWARN_VLNV` variable to true, so we don't get a warning.
:::

Finally we are describing our dependencies with `ip_link()` function.
The `ip_link()` function as first positional argument takes the `Dependent` library, and the rest of the arguments are its `Dependencies`.

We can get the `Source Filesets` by calling `get_ip_sources()` on the IP library.
First argument is the variable where to save the list of sources, second one is the name of the IP library and the last one is the file type.

We are finally printing the list of sources to stdout in the last 2 lines.

```raw
-- CPM: Adding package SoCMake@ (verilator_system_path)
V_SOURCES:
    ..../linking_ips/prim00.v
    ..../linking_ips/prim01.v
    ..../linking_ips/prim10.v
    ..../linking_ips/prim11.v
    ..../linking_ips/top.v
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: ..../linking_ips/build
```

:::caution
CMake property populated in this case will be `VERILOG_SOURCES`, the library `top` will only hold its own `VERILOG_SOURCES` in this case `top.v`, so if you use `get_target_property(V_SOURCES top VERILOG_SOURCES)` you will only get one file, if you want to get the files of all IPs use `get_ip_sources()`
:::

We can see that the order of the printed files is respected and that the lowest hierarchy IPs files are first.

:::tip
Running `make graphviz` on the previous example will generate the graph shown above
:::

:::tip
It is recommended to keep libraries in separate directories and CMakeLists.txt files, and ideally on their own GIT repositories.
