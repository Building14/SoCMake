# Getting Started

The SoCMake source code is available on the following [link](https://gitlab.cern.ch/socmake/SoCMake).

## Dependencies

Only mandatory SoCMake dependencies are `CMake>=3.25.0` and `make`.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="PIP">
```
```bash
pip install cmake==3.26.3
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="WGET">
```
```bash
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.26.3/cmake-3.26.3-linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x cmake-3.26.3-linux-x86_64.sh
./cmake-3.26.3-linux-x86_64.sh --skip-license --prefix=$(pwd)/cmake
export PATH=$(pwd)/cmake/bin:$PATH
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="APT">
```
````bash
apt-get install cmake
````

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Usage

Since `SoCMake` runs on CMake scripting language, no installation is required. <br />
It is recommended to fetch the SoCMake locally within your `CMake` project. <br />
There are multiple ways to add SoCMake within project, 2 of them are with `CPM` or inbuilt `FetchContent`.
In both cases SoCMake will be downloaded during configuration phase of the project, only the first time.

It is recommended to create a file `deps/deps.cmake` with the content from one of the 2 options:

### deps/deps.cmake

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="FetchContent">
```
```cmake title="deps/deps.cmake" showLineNumbers
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(SoCMake
    GIT_REPOSITORY "ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/socrates/SoCMake.git"
    GIT_TAG master # You can define GIT_TAG or GIT_COMMIT for specific versions
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(SoCMake)
```

FetchContent is a built in CMake function for handling dependencies.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CPM.cmake">
```
```cmake title="deps/deps.cmake" showLineNumbers
set(CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION 0.38.1)             # Define CPM version to be downloaded
include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/CPM.cmake) # Include the CPM.cmake downloader

CPMAddPackage(              # Add SoCMake as a package
    NAME SoCMake
    GIT_TAG master          # You can define GIT_TAG or VERSION for versioning
    GIT_REPOSITORY "ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/socrates/SoCMake.git"  # GIT_REPOSITORY or URL
    )
```

This is the recomended way of adding SoCMake.

In the line 2 we are including `deps/CPM.cmake` installation script, which needs to be placed in the repository.

```cmake title="deps/CPM.cmake"
if(CPM_SOURCE_CACHE)
  set(CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION "${CPM_SOURCE_CACHE}/cpm/CPM_${CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION}.cmake")
elseif(DEFINED ENV{CPM_SOURCE_CACHE})
  set(CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION "$ENV{CPM_SOURCE_CACHE}/cpm/CPM_${CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION}.cmake")
else()
  set(CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/cmake/CPM_${CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION}.cmake")
endif()

# Expand relative path. This is important if the provided path contains a tilde (~)
get_filename_component(CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION ${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION} ABSOLUTE)

function(download_cpm)
  message(STATUS "Downloading CPM.cmake to ${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION}")
  file(DOWNLOAD
       https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake/releases/download/v${CPM_DOWNLOAD_VERSION}/CPM.cmake
       ${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION}
  )
endfunction()

if(NOT (EXISTS ${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION}))
  download_cpm()
else()
  # resume download if it previously failed
  file(READ ${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION} check)
  if("${check}" STREQUAL "")
    download_cpm()
  endif()
  unset(check)
endif()

include(${CPM_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION})
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### CMakeLists.txt

In the main `CMakeLists.txt` include `deps/deps.cmake`.
It should look like this:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.25)
project(example NONE)

include("deps/deps.cmake")
```

After the previous code block, all of the SoCMake functions are available.

### Directory structure

The directory tree of the project should look like this

```cmake
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── deps
    ├── CPM.cmake
    └── deps.cmake
```

### Running CMake

Since CMake is endorsing out-of-source builds, meaning that the source files and build artifacts are in separate directories.
We are creating a `build` directory.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
```

After executing CMake we should ge the following messages:

```bash
-- Downloading CPM.cmake to .../build/cmake/CPM_0.38.1.cmake
-- CPM: Adding package SoCMake@ (master)
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: .../build
```

By default the packages will be downloaded in `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/_deps/`.
This is possible to change by setting [`FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html#variable:FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR) before the first `CPMAddPackage` command.

:::tip
For larger projects it is recommended to set `set(FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/_deps)` in `deps/deps.cmake`, this will download all the dependencies git repository wide, so they will be available from different subdirectories like `verification`, `documentation` etc...

The previous example only set up the project, but we didnt add any design files or added any targets.
